Dependencies
------------

This engine is meant to be used together with JUCE, see juce.com. It inherits
various JUCE classes, to easily allow implementing your own audio features.

With the _Foleys Video Engine_ license there is no JUCE license included.
JUCE can be used free for GPL projects and there are commercial licenses for
closed source software, including a free personal license. More information
is available on https://shop.juce.com/get-juce


This project links optionally to the FFmpeg library, see https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html.
FFmpeg is provided under the LGPL version 2.1, so it is ok to link against it.
However, by licensing _Foleys Video Engine_ you are still bound by their license.

You can disable any FFmpeg in the JUCE Projucer when you setup your project.


Free use for personal and open source use
-----------------------------------------

You are allowed to use this project under the GPL v3 free of charge. In this case
you are required to display a copyright note, that it was made using the
Video Engine provided by _Foleys Finest Audio Ltd._


Paid License for small teams
----------------------------

The paid licenses will appear soon. Please stay tuned or get in touch with:
Daniel: developer@foleysfinest.com


Paid License for bigger companies
---------------------------------

The paid licenses will appear soon. Please stay tuned or get in touch with:
Daniel: developer@foleysfinest.com



As this project is still in early stages, more documentation about the licensing options
is about to come.
